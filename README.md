# NASA Demo Project

## Introduction

This is a demo project to showcase my knowledge of React, Next, Typescript, Tailwind and Jest using the NASA APOD API to get the backend data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js: You need Node.js to run this project, as it's a JavaScript runtime. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. npm or Yarn: These are package managers for the Node.js environment. They come bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install them separately.

3. A code editor: You need a code editor to write and edit your code. Visual Studio Code is a good option, and you can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

4. Git: You need Git for version control. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

5. Knowledge of React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Jest: You should be familiar with these technologies to understand and modify the code.

To see the specific versions of each technology refer to [this file](./package.json)

### Installation

To install the project run this commands:

    git clone https://github.com/diego-portillo/nasa-project.git

    cd nasa-project

    npm install

    npm run dev



## Usage

This application consists of several pages:

1. **Home Page**: This is the landing page of the application in the / path. It provides an overview of the application and its links.

2. **About Page**: This page provides information about the APOD API in the /about path.

3. **Today Page**: Each day a different picture is published in the API so this section shows the image of the day in the /today path.

4. **Date Page**: This page takes the date you put in the path /date/YYYY-MM-DD to explore pictures of other dates.
